# ECE 176 Project: Understanding Implication of Using U-Net as Discriminator in DC-GANs

This repository contains the project work done for ECE 176 - Introduction to Deep Learning & Applications at UCSD ECE Department. The project focuses on exploring the implications of using U-Net as a discriminator in Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs).

## Abstract

Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs are based on a unique architecture where a generator and a discriminator model compete against each other to improve the generatorâ€™s performance. This Project is aimed at implementing GANs with a general architecture as well as a modified version of GANs where a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture is used to understand how different discriminator architectures can make a difference in Generating better-quality images. We try to explore how U-net GANs capacity over vanilla GAN where it also describes the part of the generated image that looks real or fake rather than a binary output of vanilla GANs model.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to investigate and understand the implications of using U-Net as a discriminator in DC-GANs. Specifically, we aim to:

- Evaluate the performance of DC-GANs with U-Net discriminator compared to traditional CNN-based discriminator.
- Assess the quality of generated images using different discriminator architectures.
- Analyze the impact of employing U-Net discriminator on training stability, convergence speed, and mode collapse.
